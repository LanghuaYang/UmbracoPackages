# Page Visit Counter

Umbraco 7.4.3+

Is a statistics counter for individual pages

Has a simple label property editor that shows how many times the page has been visited.

It creates a macro, macro partial view, and a data type.

Add the data type to your document type, add the macro to the template, and start counting
